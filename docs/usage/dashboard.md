# Quick start for Dashboard

## Usage Dashboard
The Usage Dashboard in Demo Labs Lineage AI provides a comprehensive overview of your system's performance and resource utilization. Think of it as your command center for monitoring all critical metrics and system health in one place.

### What's in the Usage Dashboard?
* **Current Month Usage**: A quick snapshot showing token consumption, system uptimes, and performance metrics
* **Performance Charts**: Visual representations of your system's performance and resource utilization
* **Recent Data Pipelines**: Latest analysed pipeline reports and their current status
* **System Health Indicators**: Real-time status of various system components

### Current Month Usage Section
This section gives you a bird's-eye view of your system's current performance through four key cards:

* **Token Info Card**
    - Shows your current token usage and limits
    - Displays usage trends
    - Helps track API consumption patterns

* **UI Operation Uptime**
    - Displays total uptime duration (e.g., "100h 56m")
    - Shows percentage changes compared to previous periods
    - Includes analytics icon for quick status identification

* **LLM API Uptime**
    - Monitors your AI model's API availability
    - Tracks continuous operation time
    - Shows performance stability metrics

* **Database Uptime**
    - Monitors database system availability
    - Shows uptime duration
    - Tracks performance trends

<!--ðŸ’ª **Did you know?** You can click on any uptime card to view detailed metrics and historical data for that specific component! -->
### Charts Section
The dashboard features two primary visualization tools:

* **Monthly Token Usage Chart**
    - Bar chart showing token consumption patterns
    - Month-by-month comparison
    - Usage trends and patterns
    - Helps in capacity planning and resource allocation

* **Uptime Performance Chart**
    - Line chart displaying system performance
    - Real-time tracking of various components
    - Historical performance data
    - Helps identify potential bottlenecks or issues

### Recent Data Pipelines
This section provides visibility into your data operations:

* **Pipeline Status**
    - Current state of each pipeline
    - Progress indicators
    - Error notifications if any

* **Performance Metrics**
    - Processing times
    - Resource utilization
    - Success/failure rates

ðŸ’ª **Did you know?** You can click the view button for any pipeline to see a detailed visualization report of it!

### System Health Monitoring
The platform continuously monitors various system components:

* **Component Status**
    - Real-time health indicators
    - Performance metrics
    - Alert notifications

* **Response Times**
    - Component-wise response times
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Latency tracking

### Best Practices for Using the Dashboard

* **Regular Monitoring**
    - Check the dashboard at the start of your day
    - Monitor token usage trends
    - Keep an eye on system health indicators

* **Performance Optimization**
    - Use charts to identify peak usage periods
    - Monitor resource utilization patterns
    - Plan capacity based on usage trends

* **Issue Resolution**
    - Respond promptly to alerts
    - Check error logs when issues occur
    - Monitor system recovery times

<!-- ðŸ’ª **Did you know?** You can set up custom alerts for specific metrics and receive notifications when they exceed your defined thresholds! -->
